noGo

noGo is a cross-platform sgf viewer and editor. It is written in Python, and uses the Gomill suite of Go utilities to read SGFs and keep track of board logic. The GUI is built using the kivy graphical framework.

noGo is a work in progress, and any questions, bug reports, requests, suggestions or anything else are welcome! Please contact alexanderjohntaylor@gmail.com
